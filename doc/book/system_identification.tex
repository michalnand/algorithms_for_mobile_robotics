\chapter{System identification}

In this chapter we leverage state space models for describing mathematical model of robot.
We consider differential drive robot, with two independently controller wheels. 
For comfort the state of robot will be its linear distance $x$, linear velocity $v$, 
robot angle $\theta$ and angular rate $\omega$.
This coordinate system differs from more used cartesian, however, it allow us to avoid 
non-linear model (containing sine, cosine rotation matrix), and further we can use 
fully linear state space model, and linear controller. 

Note, the upprt level of controll, e.g. path planener, will probaly still needs to works 
within cartesian coordinates, however, this controll loop is running relatively slow, 
so the excesive computations doesn't matter.
