\chapter{Software architecture}

Every robot must process data in real time. In most practical cases, volume of data is not huge, 
however, strict response time must be guranteed.

\begin{itemize}
    \item motor controller, running arround 4kHz
    \item analog sensor reading, hundrets of hertz
    \item GPS, 1Hz
    \item Lidar, arround 10 .. 20Hz
    \item Camera, 25Hz
    \item Encoders - completely asynchronois 
    \item path planning, 10s to 100s hertz
\end{itemize}

\section{Example embedded project structure}

The microcontroller stm32f722 is good start.
